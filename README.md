A simple game I'm currently writing. Game uses python and pygame.

Player moves only by jumping on slippery floor. Player can also jump on walls.

To run game type `./main.py` into terminal, or something like that. I'm not
your boss. Do wathever you want.

You probably want to install pygame. Here are some
[instructions](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted#Pygame%20Installation).
Spoiler alert, just run this inside your terminal:
```
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```
